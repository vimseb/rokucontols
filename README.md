# Controller for a Roku TV (windows)
### This program is a controller for a Roku TV. It ensures the TV and the controlling device are on the same network. The program accepts the Roku TV's IP address as a command-line argument or prompts the user to input it. After ensuring the GUI is active, the program uses the provided IP address to interact with the Roku TV.

Find the ip of the Roku tv either with nmap or on the tv settings and pass it in as a argument or the program will prompt you to enter a ip adress.

And make sure you click on the gui app to activate the controls.
